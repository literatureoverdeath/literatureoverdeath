            <h3>Cesare Pavese</h3>

            <p><span class="trauma">Cesare Pavese was born in Santo Stefano Belbo, a small town in the province of Cuneo, on 9 September 1908. Despite the economic wealth, Pavese's childhood was not happy: a sister and two brothers, born before him, had died prematurely. His mother, in poor health, had to entrust him, as soon as he was born, to a nurse from a nearby town and then, when she took him back with her to Turin, to another nurse. His father died of brain cancer when Cesare was five. The authoritarian mother had to raise the two children alone: ​​her rigorous upbringing contributed to accentuate the already introverted and unstable character of Cesare.</span></p>
            <p>During his high school years, Cesare stayed home from school for three months due to pleurisy, which he had taken for a <span class="love">long time in the rain (6 pm to midnight) to wait in vain for a variety singer-dancer named Milly. in a place frequented by students, with whom he had fallen in love and with whom he had made an appointment.</span> It was 1925 and he was attending the second high school. <span class="trauma">The following year he was deeply shaken by the tragic death of his classmate, Elico Baraldi, who had killed himself with a revolver shot. Pavese was tempted to emulate that gesture</span>, as evidenced by the poem sent on January 9, 1927 to his friend Sturani. "I went one evening in December / along a small country lane / all deserted, with a tumult in my heart. / I had a revolver behind me." </p>
            <p>He lived mostly in Turin, where he <span class="work">graduated in literature with a thesis on W. Whitman; disciple of Augusto Monti, a friend of L. Ginzburg and other anti-fascist intellectuals, since the 1920s he read numerous American authors and began translating English and American writers. In the following years he carried out an intense work in this field translating, among other things, works by Defoe, Dickens, Melville, Joyce.</span></p>
            <p><span class="public">Between 1935 and 1936, for his relations with the militants of the Giustizia e Libertà group, he was arrested, tried and sent to confinement in Brancaleone Calabro;</span> back in Turin, <span class="work">he was one of the main collaborators of the Einaudi publishing house.</span> <span class="trauma">But his life was dominated by a deep sense of loneliness and emptiness, stronger after the end of a love experience lived in the last years of university. Starting from 1940 a new, difficult friendship was that with F. Pivano.</span></p>
            <p><span class="work">In 1942 he was hired directly as an employee of the Einaudi publishing house</span>: after a stay in Rome, he took refuge during the German occupation in a village in Monferrato, with his sister, looking with bitterness at the events of the Resistance. <span class="public">After the Liberation, he joined the Communist party and began to collaborate with the "Unità""</span>. <span class="work">Years of very intense work followed, in which he wrote and published his most successful works.</span></p>
            <p>In 1950, he made a trip to Rome where he stayed from December 30, 1949 to January 6, 1950, but was disappointed: on January 1 he wrote in his diary: <span class="trauma">“Even the pain, the suicide, created life, amazement, tension. After all, you've always felt suicidal temptations. You were abandoned. You stripped off your armor. You were a boy. The idea of ​​suicide was a life protest. What a death not to want to die anymore.</span> "In this state of mind <span class="love">he met Constance Dowling at a friend's house, who had arrived in Rome with her sister Doris, who had acted in Riso amaro with Vittorio Gassman and Raf Vallone, and, struck by her beauty, fell in love with her.</span></p>
            <p><span class="love">Returning to Turin, he began to think that, once again, he had missed the opportunity, and when Constance went to Turin for a rest period, the two met again and the woman convinced him to go with her to Cervinia, where Pavese deluded himself again. Constance in fact had an affair with the actor Andrea Checchi and soon left for America to try her luck in Hollywood, leaving the writer embittered and unhappy.</span></p>
            <p>​​In the summer of 1950 he spent a few days in Liguria, the summer destination of many intellectuals, where he met an 18-year-old Romilda Bollati, sister of the publisher Giulio Bollati. <span class="love">The two had a short love story, as evidenced by the manuscripts of the writer, who called her by the pseudonym of "Pierina".</span> <span class="trauma">However, not even this new feeling was able to dispel her depression.</span></p>
            <p>On 17 August he had written in the diary, published in 1952 with the title "This Business of living". Diary 1935-1950: <span class="trauma">«This is the final balance of the unfinished year, which I will not finish» and on 18 August he closed the diary by writing: «All this sucks. Not words. A gesture. I will not write any more ". In the throes of a profound existential unease,</span> <span class="love">tormented by the recent disappointment in love with Constance Dowling, to whom he dedicated the verses of “Death shall using your eyes”,</span> <span class="trauma">he prematurely put an end to his life on August 27, 1950,</span> in a hotel room Roma of Piazza Carlo Felice in Turin, which he had occupied the day before. He was found lying on the bed after ingesting more than ten sleeping pills.</p>
            <p>On the first page of the Dialogues with Leucò, which was on the table, he had written: «I forgive everyone and I ask everyone for forgiveness. All right? Don't do too much gossip».</p>

            <h3>Sylvia Plath</h3>

            <p>Sylvia Plath was born on October 22, 1932, in Boston, Massachusetts. <span class="work">At eight years old she published her first poem in the Boston Herald's children's section. Over the next few years, Plath published multiple poems in regional magazines and newspapers. At age 11, Plath began keeping a journal.</span> <span class="trauma">Her father, Otto Plath died on November 5, 1940, a week and a half after Plath's eighth birthday, of complications following the amputation of a foot due to untreated diabetes. Plath experienced a loss of faith after her father's death and remained ambivalent about religion throughout her life.</span> After Otto's death, Aurelia, the mother, moved her children and her parents to Wellesley, Massachusetts. It was the year 1942. In one of her last prose pieces, Plath commented that her first nine years "sealed themselves off like a ship in a bottle—beautiful, inaccessible, obsolete, a fine, white flying myth".</p>
            <p><span class="work">In 1950, Plath attended Smith College, a private women's liberal arts college in Massachusetts. She excelled academically. After her third year of college, Plath was awarded a coveted position as a guest editor at “Mademoiselle” magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City.</span> <span class="trauma">but the experience was not what she had hoped. She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas — a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, "more than life itself". She hung around the White Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, but he was already on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs to see if she had enough "courage" to kill herself. During this time she was refused admission to the Harvard writing seminar. Following electroconvulsive therapy for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt on August 24, 1953 by crawling under the front porch and taking her mother's sleeping pills.</span></p>
            <p>She survived this first suicide attempt  and spent the next six months in psychiatric care, receiving more electric and insulin shock treatment. Plath seemed to make a good recovery and returned to college.</p>
            <p><span class="love">Plath first met poet Ted Hughes on February 25, 1956. She described him as "a singer, story-teller, lion and world-wanderer" with "a voice like the thunder of God"</span>. The couple married on June 16, 1956, in London. In June 1957, Plath and Hughes moved to the United States, and from September, Plath <span class="work">taught at Smith College, her alma mater. She found it difficult to both teach and have enough time and energy to write</span>, and in the middle of 1958, the couple moved to Boston. <span class="work">Plath took a job as a receptionist in the psychiatric unit of Massachusetts General Hospital and in the evening sat in on creative writing seminars given by poet Robert Lowell (also attended by the writers Anne Sexton and George Starbuck)</span>.</p>
            <p>Both Lowell and Sexton encouraged Plath to write from her experience and she did so. <span class="trauma">She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton</span>, <span class="work">who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began to consider herself as a more serious, focused poet and short-story writer</span>. In February 1961, <span class="trauma">Plath's second pregnancy ended in miscarriage; several of her poems, including "Parliament Hill Fields", address this event. In a letter to her therapist, Plath wrote that Hughes beat her two days before the miscarriage. In June 1962, Plath had a car accident which she described as one of many suicide attempts</span>. In July 1962, <span class="love">Plath discovered Hughes had been having an affair with Assia Wevill; in September Plath and Hughes separated</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="work">Beginning in October 1962, Plath experienced a great burst of creativity and wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life</span>. <span class="trauma">Before her death, Plath tried several times to take her own life. On August 24, 1953, she overdosed on sleeping pills then, in June 1962, she drove her car off the side of the road, into a river, which she later said was an attempt to take her own life.</span></p>
            <p>In January 1963, Plath spoke with John Horder, her general practitioner and a close friend who lived near her. She described the current depressive episode she was experiencing; it had been ongoing for six or seven months. <span class="trauma">While for most of the time she had been able to continue working, her depression had worsened and become severe, "marked by constant agitation, suicidal thoughts and inability to cope with daily life". Plath struggled with insomnia, taking medication at night to induce sleep, and frequently woke up early.  She lost 20 pounds (9 kg)</span>. However, she continued to take care of her physical appearance and did not outwardly speak of feeling guilty or unworthy.</p>
            <p>Horder prescribed her an anti-depressant, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, a few days before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. The nurse was due to arrive at nine on the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath with the care of her children. Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat but eventually gained access with the help of a workman, Charles Langridge. <span class="trauma">They found Plath dead with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. She was 30 years old.</span></p>

            <h3>Virginia Woolf</h3>

            <p>Adeline Virginia Woolf (25 January 1882 – 28 March 1941) was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London, the seventh child of mother Julia Prinsep Jackson and father Leslie Stephen. <span class="work">From 1897 to 1901, she attended the Ladies' Department of King's College London, where she studied classics and history</span> <span class="public">and came into contact with early reformers of women's higher education and the women's rights movement</span>.</p>
            <p>Julia Stephen dealt with her husband's depressions and his need for attention, <span class="trauma">which created resentment in her children, boosted his self-confidence, nursed her parents in their final illness, and had many commitments outside the home that would eventually wear her down. Her frequent absences and the demands of her husband instilled a sense of insecurity in her children that had a lasting effect on her daughters</span>.
            <span class="trauma">Another issue the children had to deal with was Leslie Stephen's temper, Woolf describing him as "the tyrant father".[131][132] Eventually, she became deeply ambivalent about her father. He had given her his ring on her eighteenth birthday and she had a deep emotional attachment as his literary heir, writing about her "great devotion for him"</span>.</p>
            <p>Woolf stated that her half-brother Gerald Duckworth <span class="trauma">molested her when she was six years old</span>. It has been suggested that this led to a lifetime of sexual fear and resistance to masculine authority. Against a background of over-committed and distant parents, suggestions that this was a dysfunctional family must be evaluated. Eventhough, <span class="trauma">Virginia's accounts of being continually sexually abused during the time that she lived at 22 Hyde Park Gate, have been cited by some critics as a possible cause of her mental health issues, although there are likely to be a number of contributing factors.</span>
            <span class="trauma">From the age of 13, following the death of her mother, Woolf suffered periodic mood swings from severe depression to manic excitement, including psychotic episodes</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="work">Concerning her studies, she was encouraged by her father, Woolf began writing professionally in 1900</span>. Following her father's death in 1904, the Stephen family moved from Kensington to the more bohemian Bloomsbury, where, in conjunction with the brothers' intellectual friends, they formed the artistic and literary Bloomsbury Group. <span class="love">In 1912, she married Leonard Woolf</span>, and in 1917, the couple founded the Hogarth Press, which published much of her work. They rented a home in Sussex and moved there permanently in 1940. <span class="love">Woolf also had romantic relationships with women, including Vita Sackville-West, who also published her books through Hogarth Press. Both women's literature became inspired by their relationship, which lasted until Woolf's death</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="trauma">Although Virginia expressed the opinion her father was her favourite parent, and although she had only turned thirteen when her mother died, she was profoundly influenced by her mother throughout her life</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="work">During the interwar period, Woolf was an important part of London's literary and artistic society</span>. In 1915, she published her first novel, "The Voyage Out", through her half-brother's publishing house, Gerald Duckworth and Company. Her best-known works include the novels "Mrs Dalloway" (1925), "To the Lighthouse" (1927) and "Orlando" (1928). She is also known for her essays, including "A Room of One's Own" (1929). <span class="public">Woolf became one of the central subjects of the 1970s movement of feminist criticism and her works have since garnered much attention and widespread commentary for "inspiring feminism"</span>. Her works have been translated into more than 50 languages.</p>
            <p><span class="trauma">After completing the manuscript of her last novel (posthumously published), Between the Acts (1941), Woolf fell into a depression similar to that which she had earlier experienced. The onset of World War II, the destruction of her London home during the Blitz, and the cool reception given to her biography of her late friend Roger Fry all worsened her condition until she was unable to work.</span></p>
            <p><span class="trauma">After World War II began, Woolf's diary indicates that she was obsessed with death, which figured more and more as her mood darkened.On 28 March 1941, Woolf drowned herself by filling her overcoat pockets with stones and walking into the River Ouse near her home</span>.
            In her suicide note, addressed to her husband, she wrote:</p>
            <p>"Dearest, I feel certain that <span class="trauma">I am going mad again</span>. I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times. And I shan't recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don't think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. <span class="trauma">I can't fight it any longer</span>. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. <span class="trauma">You see, I can't even write this properly. I can't read.</span> What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that—everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been. V"</p>
