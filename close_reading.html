                    <h4 id="critica_title">Critical Analysis</h4>
                    <p id="primo">
                        This poem written by Cesare Pavese on 11 March 1950, after a short vacation in Cervinia with the American actress Constant Dowling, is the first of 10 poems - 8 in Italian and 2 in English - dedicated to Connie, the last illusion of the writer's love. The last poem has the date of 11 April 1950.
                        By reading this first poem and comparing it with the last one (cfr. Lust blues, to be read some day), a transition is clearly perceivable from hope for a lasting love with which to build a family life to the awareness that it was "only a flirt" which will be the pretext that will lead him to commit suicide.
                        </p>
                    <p id="secondo" style="display: none;">This poem, together with the first and the following one, describe the initial moment of the poet's falling in love with the actress, also recreating the initial moment and the geographical environment where his emotional transport for her was born.
                    </p>
                    <p id="terzo" style="display: none;">From a critical point of view, Davide Rondoni, poet and writer, points out through this poem the contradiction inherent in Pavese's personality and work: "He is someone who has a great fascination for beauty and immediately feels its suicide; he is someone who continues to fix himself in his loneliness and in life he is a writer. He felt this attraction to the absolute, but deprived of heat. What is stinging, however, is magnetic in Pavese, it is what attracts us, because we are like this: man is an oxymoronic animal that does not resolve itself ". But what allows the contradiction in human nature not to lead to tragedy? "The radicality of Pavese - added Rondoni - the seriousness with which he carried this closed pain of his, is his weak sob that allows perhaps our sob to be stronger". So man waits, but this tension of his is aimed at something he does not know, which must come from another.
                    </p>
                    <p id="quarto" style="display: none;">In this poem there is a strong contrast between sight and hearing. On the one hand there is sight, eyes, the world of looks, non-verbal communication; on the other hand we find the ears always deaf and the cry always mute: the only thing that can be heard is a profound and oxymoronic silence, in which the screams are silent, the lips sealed, communication impossible. 
                        The stanzas end with another extension of death: that of hope. In fact, in the first verse the poet emphasizes how hope, which gives life, is on balance only an illusion with no saving power. In the second, with the concluding verse "We’ll go down in silence", Pavese seems to want to express the inexorability of loneliness and oblivion.
                        </p>
                    <p id="quinto" style="display: none;">On 25 March, the same day he wrote the fifth poem, “You, wind of March”, Pavese wrote on the diary the famous reflection that confirms his prostration in his relationship with the actress: “You don't kill yourself for the love of a woman. We kill ourselves because a love, any love, reveals us in our nakedness, miserable, helplessness, nothing ”.
                        After these, two poems others follow in which the poet hopes to meet his beloved in Rome and hopes to have another chance to resume love with her and then writes the poem “I will pass through Piazza di Spagna”.
                        </p>
                    <p id="sesto" style="display: none;">“I shall go through the Piazza di Spagna” has color, light, sound as core themes: the author pursues a sad love and ends up rediscovering spring. Despite the existential torment expressed in many passages of his production, here Pavese tries to smile at the idea – or the illusion – of seeing Connie again in Rome. Connie, as evanescent as she is beautiful. Just like the freedom that we chase these days.
                        This poem, between those ones about Connie, "is the most teeming, polychrome and moved; in it the epiphany of the madonna, white goddess, American Aphrodite, clear and luminously nefarious, takes place in a polytonal and dynamic Roman context, less funeriously opaque than other occasions ", writes the philologist and essayist Roberto Gigliucci.
                        
                        The tone of all the poems is invocative and melancholic but there are also pauses and verses that express all the poet's hope for a possible new meeting with the American actress. “I will pass through Piazza di Spagna”, in fact celebrates the dream of the poet's happiness for a fantastic and euphoric meeting with Constance at the actress's home in Rome. But both the happiness and the meeting were only a dream of the poet.
                        </p>
                    <p id="settimo" style="display: none;">This poem and the following, are poems of expectation of the poet who hopes to meet Connie again but also poems of regret for the beautiful few days spent together in Cervinia.
                        The penultimate poem, “The night you slept”, is another poem in which the poet imagines that Connie will return to America, to her home in New York, and even the cats will know of her return.
                        </p>
                    <p id="ottavo" style="display: none;">Pavese dreams of a life with Constance and also tries to help her career by writing the story for a film suitable for her beloved and sister Doris, who is also an actress, entitled “The two sisters”. While Doris Dowling is enthusiastic, Constance is silent, probably does not want to feel obliged to the writer, also because she is divided between him and the actor Andrea Checchi. In fact, he refuses his offer of marriage and on April 20, 1950 he returns to the United States to try his luck in Hollywood.
                    </p>
                    <p id="nono" style="display: none;">“The cats will know”  is the penultimate poem written by Cesare Pavese for the American actress Connie Dowling, with whom he had fallen in love for a year, unrequited. The poem was written by Cesare Pavese in Rome, during a long night waiting for the actress who, according to gossip, would have spent a good part of that night with an actor with whom she was having an affair.

                        In the poem, all the sadness and disappointment come out, for an encounter that is annihilated with respect to expectations, and starting from it, and from one's existential condition, it envelops all humanity with a veil of sadness, in the awareness of life.
                        </p>
                    <p id="decimo" style="display: none;">This poem refers to the real torment of Pavese's life: "someone was hurt a long time ago". For the first time, in December 1937, Pavese wrote: "this year my long and secret shame has come to a head". The fateful date that recurs throughout the diary is Friday the 13th, when "the woman with the hoarse voice", Connie,  whom he had loved for years, told him that he was not made for a sentimental and physical life.

                        This last poem is a dramatic poem because the poet takes leave of Connie and realizes that this attempt at love had been little more than a flirtation for her. But for the poet it was yet another love failure by a woman and it will also be the last as Connie's refusal will influence the decision of his extreme gesture.
                        The last poem was written in English and was translated into Italian by Italo Calvino. 
                        </p>
                    <p id="undicesimo" style="display: none;">This is Sylvia Plath's last poem, written mere days before she committed suicide. It is a short, bleak, and brutal piece that reflects the depth of her depression. 
                        The poem is made up of a series of powerful images that get to the heart of depression and the treatment of women within historical and contemporary society. Plath depicts this woman as finally “perfected”. She has reached a state where no one can touch her and she is just as placid and calm as men would like her to be.  Alongside her body are those of her two children. She took them into death with her in order to shuttle them back, metaphorically, into her body. The poem ends with images of menstruation, blood, death, and the moon. 
                        This poem is generally characteristic of Plath's late work, which, as Tim Kendall writes, features "a style of heightened detachment and resignation in the face of an intractable destiny." However, critic Stephen Gould Axelrod looks at the poem through a very different lens – that of postmodernist and linguistic criticism. In his reading, the text is indeterminate, with the words completely distinct from meaning. Axelrod refers to Roland Barthes's idea of the blank edge of discourse, wherein one can perceive the death of language. He considers "Edge" to be a "poetic epitaph." 
                        </p>
                    <p id="dodicesimo" style="display: none;">Given that this poem was written in the last few weeks of her life, there is an underlying somber tone. ‘Kindness’ is portrayed with irony; it is shallow and trivial, and though ultimately it does offer Plath love in the form of her children, we know that this wasn’t sufficient. From a technical point of view, the organised structure is typical of Plath, four five-lined stanzas, with no regular rhyme scheme, but consistency in imagery and metaphor. Plath’s language is, as always, concise, and the imagery dense and complex. Unlike some of her more obscure poems, this is relatively simple to interpret. 
                        The overarching theme is kindness expressed in a shallow, distorted, ironic manner. It is personified as ‘Dame Kindness’, like a pantomime figure, and offers sugary, insubstantial solutions that have no depth. Although kindness does at the end offer a serious answer in the form of the poet’s love for her children, this we know was ultimately not a solution.
                        </p>
                    <p id="tredicesimo" style="display: none;">‘Words’ is a very short poem and it consists of four stanzas of five lines each. It writes in an open form with irregular meter and only occasional rhyme. The theme of the poem is about the creative impulse of a poet and her effort to write something of permanent value to make her immortal. The tone of the poem is somber and bleak. The theme is present through metaphors: axes, horses, water, the mirror, stars, etc. The interlocking nature of the metaphors is the only way to understand the poem and it also unites it. The poem demonstrates a distinctly spiritual dimension of Plath’s life governed by something outside herself, something fixed and external. “Words” therefore reveals the emotional journey of her life from creative power to despair and death. 
                    </p>
                    <p id="quattordicesimo" style="display: none;">All the fragments relate to one character, Bernard, deeply concerned with language, and one of his first apparent traits is his obsession with “making phrases.” As a child, Bernard sees language as a way to mediate and control reality, to turn random events into a chain of meaning. Bernard has trouble capturing the lives of others in his stories, and he is nagged by a sense that some element of the truth always escapes him.
                        Over time, Bernard comes to think that the problem with his stories is inherent in language itself. Reality, Bernard comes to think, is always more complex than our words can grasp. Part of the reason this is so is related to Bernard’s concept of identity as fluid and changing. Bernard sees himself as a compound being, influenced by and even composed of the people who surround him. Bernard spends much time trying to break down the barriers between different selves. 
                        Bernard dissatisfaction with language and traditional narrative echoes many of Woolf’s own concerns and gives a clue as to why she felt the need to try bold experiments with the nature of fiction, such as The Waves itself. In her memoirs, Woolf tells of certain moments, which she calls “moments of being,” in which she gains a direct perception of reality, apart from the distortions and omissions of language. Bernard has such a moment toward the end of the novel, and the moment is a kind of culmination for his character.
